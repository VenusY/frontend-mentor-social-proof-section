# frontend-mentor-social-proof-section
Solution to the Frontend Mentor social proof section challenge using CSS flexbox.

The layout was split into two rows, then the top half was further split into two columns, all using flexbox. The staggered effect for both the top right and bottom half of the page was created using the justify-content property associated with flexbox.
